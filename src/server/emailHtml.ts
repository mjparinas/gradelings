// Received mail is shown in the admin Inbox as the sender wrote it, but never trusted. Three layers keep it safe:
// 1. This allowlist sanitizer drops scripts, event handlers, forms, frames, embeds and every link scheme but
//    http(s) and mailto, so the markup that reaches a browser can't run code.
// 2. The page is served on its own (`/api/admin/inbox/view/`) with a strict policy (`EMAIL_VIEW_POLICY`): it is
//    sandboxed without scripts or same-origin access, and loads nothing from the network unless images are asked for.
// 3. The panel shows it in an <iframe sandbox> with the same limits, so even a sanitizer miss can't reach the
//    panel, its cookies or its API.
// Remote images are left out until the admin asks for them, because loading one tells the sender it was read.
