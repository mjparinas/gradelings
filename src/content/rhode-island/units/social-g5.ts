// Rhode Island Grade 5 social studies, United States history to Reconstruction: the Early Republic (SS5.4.1), the
// expansion of United States territory (SS5.4.2) and the movement of people west (SS5.4.3), with Rhode Island's late

// Revolution, the Civil War and Reconstruction) is practised with adopted units (see ../plan/social.ts).
